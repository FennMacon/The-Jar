                <p><b>The Vision:</b> A vigorous producing organization that brings a global perspective to a diverse, vital and growing community. Together, we create experiences that awaken the courage to honor our differences and celebrate our shared humanity.</p>

                <p><b>The Mission:</b> Produce cultural encounters that delight, ignite, and unite a diverse and vibrant community.</p>

                <p><b>The Values:</b>  Curiosity, Imagination, Belonging</p>

                <p><b>The Plan:</b> Assuming Bostonians would like to engage in cultural experiences with a diverse and vibrant community, are Bostonians willing to take personal actions to diversify their networks to engage in cultural experiences? In order to test this question, The Jar will produce cultural encounters, using a collaborative audience making model. The formula we want to test: Cultural Encounter + Collaborative Audience Making Model = Diverse, Vibrant Community Engaging in Cultural Experiences </p>

                <p><b>Cultural Encounters:</b> Programming with Global Perspectives: Each intimate encounter will begin at 8PM with a 60-minute performance, followed by a moderated dialogue, followed by dessert – a time for community building.</p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 0"><b>Collaborative Audience Making Model:</b> The Jar is experimenting with a collaborative audience making model that invites audience members to become conveners – an opportunity to build community through courage and kindness. A convener will commit to 6 tickets, and:
                <li>Attend with their/her/his +1 (partner, close friend)</li>
                <li> people they would normally experience culture with</li>
                <li>2 people they wouldn’t normally experience culture with – people who may not look like them, pray like them, love like them, come from the same socio-economic background, etc; these 2 people could be people the convener knows (neighbor, colleague), and most importantly, these are people who the convener would like to get to know better</li></p>
